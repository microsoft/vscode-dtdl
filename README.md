# DTDL Editor for Visual Studio Code

## Overview
The [Digital Twin Definition Language](https://aka.ms/DTDL) (DTDL) is a language for describing models for Plug and Play devices, device digital twins, and logical digital twins. Broadly, modeling enables IoT solutions to provision, use, and configure digital twins of all kinds from multiple sources in a single solution. Using DTDL to describe any digital twin’s abilities enables the IoT platform and IoT solutions to leverage the semantics of each digital twin.

With the [DTDL extension for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsciot-vscode.vscode-dtdl) , you can read and write documents using DTDL more efficiently taking full advantage of the following key features:

- Create interfaces from the command palette with predefined or customized templates. 
- Intellisense to help you with the language syntax (including auto-completion).
- Use predefined code snippets to develop DTDL efficiently. 
- Syntax validation.

## Get Started

### Create Interface

You could use the command palette to create interface from predefined or customized templates. 

- In Visual Studio Code, select **View > Command Palette** to open the VS Code command palette.
- In the command palette, enter and run the command **DTDL: Create Interface**. 
- Follow the instruction to assign the interface name. 
- If there are multiple templates existing, choose a template you need. Otherwise, the extension will the basic template as default.
- A JSON file will be created in the current folder. The file name is based on the interface name you assigned. 
- You should replace the **{company}** field in @id with your own company’s name. Note that @id is the path component of the [Digital Twin Model Identifier](https://github.com/Azure/opendigitaltwins-dtdl/blob/master/DTDL/v2/dtdlv2.md#digital-twin-model-identifier-dtmi) (DTMI) and should follow the DTMI rule to uniquely identify the device model.
- You could extend the interface with [DTDL v2](https://github.com/Azure/opendigitaltwins-dtdl/blob/master/DTDL/v2/dtdlv2.md). 


### Intellisense and Syntax validation

This extension could help you with the language syntax (including auto-completion) and also validate the syntax with [DTDL v2](https://github.com/Azure/opendigitaltwins-dtdl/blob/master/DTDL/v2/dtdlv2.md).

> Note: This extension only supports these [Semantic Types](https://github.com/Azure/opendigitaltwins-dtdl/blob/master/DTDL/v2/dtdlv2.md#semantic-types).

### Use Predefined Code Snippets

Besides the basic auto completion, this extension also provides some predefined code snippets to help you develop DTDL efficiently. 

| Code Snippet | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `dtt`  | Code snippet of telemetry |
| `dtp`  | Code snippet of property |
| `dtc`  | Code snippet of command |

### Create Your Own Template

#### Prepare your template file

You could use any DTDL file as a template to develop efficiently. Meanwhile, you could also use these predefined tags to make your template more flexible. 

- **{modelId}**: The extention will replace this tag with *dtmi:com:example:interface_name;1* when creating a new DTDL from a template. For example, if you assigned the interface name as "test", the result will be dtmi:com:example:test;1.
- **{modelName}**: The extension will replace this tag with the interface name when creating a new DTDL from a template. 

#### Import your template file

- Go to [[extension installation location](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-gallery#_where-are-extensions-installed)]/vsciot-vscode.vscode-dtdl-[extension release version]/templates
- Store your template into this folder. Keep the file name short and meaningful, because the extension will use the file name as template name. 

### Create Your Own Code Snippets

If you would like to create customized code snippets for VS Code, you could follow [Snippets in Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets)

### Contribute Your Templates and Code Snippets to the Community 

You could also contribute your templates and code snippets to the [DTDL repository](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-dtdl).

- Uploading the new templates to **templates** folder.
- Modifying and adding new code snippets to **snippets/snippets.json** file.

Once the pull request is approved, your templates and code snippets will be released with next release of DTDL extension. 

## Commands

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `DTDL: Create Interface...`  | Create new interface from predefined or customized templates. |
